# Dammy-session-and-break-timer

## This [timer](https://bestbynature.github.io/Dammy-session-and-break-timer/) works by first setting a preferred session time as well as break time using the up and down arrows as required. 

## The timer is then started by clicking the start/stop button and the countdown begins for the session.

## once the session gets to 00:00, the break timer resumes automatically and also counts down.

## Once the break timer gets to 00:00, the session resumes again and the cycle continues indefinitely. 

## Please note that once the timer starts by clicking the start/stop button, you can no longer set the preffered timing again *except* by clicking the reset button.

## [This is the link](https://bestbynature.github.io/Dammy-session-and-break-timer/) to the timer as described above.
